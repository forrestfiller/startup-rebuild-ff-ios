# Rebuild of iOS project I made during class 

In *this* version of my rebuild, I use the *storyboard* to create the UI.  The goal of the App is to pull data 
from the [**Web App**](https://ff-startups.herokuapp.com/) I created with Node and deloyed using Heroku :heart_eyes:

Note: - The UI is quite basic, this excersize is focused on the code, *mostly* ignoring the UI (sorry)
